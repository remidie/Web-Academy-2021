  <h4>"The Avengers" is a Marvel comic book movie released on May 4, 2012 and was distributed by The Walt Disney Company and Paramount Pictures and is the final movie of phase one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It is based on the comics released by Marvel in the 60's. The cast of the movie includes Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Scarlett Johanson as Black Widow, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. A basic plot summary of the movie is that Nick Fury gets a team of six individuals (Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Thor), although he only really intended to recruit five but Thor joins in after coming to Earth to sto Loki himself and Hawkeye was being mind controlled by Loki for most of the movie and only escapes his control near the end of the movie before the final battle, and uses them to fight off Loki and to stop him from invading Earth using the Tesseract and an army of Chitauri. The inciting incident of the movie is SHIELD experimenting with the tesseract and it eventually opens a doorway to another dimension, which is how Loki makes it to Earth and steals the tesseract. The death of Phil Coulson is the main event that leads to the Avengers being united to fight against, and beat, Loki into submission, and ultimately, save the world. The movie gained positive reviews and gained over $1.5 billion at the box office. </h4>
  <h5> The main reason why I put it as one of my favorite movies is because of the nostalgia I have for it and what it managed to do. I remember watching this movie all the time with my parents when I was younger and loving it, and having rewatched it recently, I can say that it still holds up pretty well and is still very rewatchable. Every time I rewatch it I notice something new about it and I love it even more for that. </h5>
