  <h4> "Kung Fu Panda" is an animated movie released on June 6, 2008 by DreamWorks Animation, starring Jack Black as Po, Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu, Lucy Liu as Viper, Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as Mantis, David Cross as Crane, and Ian McShane as Tai Lung and is the first movie of a trilogy of highly acclaimed and beloved movies. A basic plot synapses of Kung Fu Panda is that we have a Panda Bear named Po that works at a noodle shop ran by his adopted father, Mr. Ping, who is a goose, but Po wants to be so much more than that and is a huge fan of kung fu. He is late to a ceremony that will decide who of the Furious Five (Mantis, Tigress, Crane, Monkey, and Viper) will become the dragon warrior. They will go through a bunch of rigorous trials and then the dragon warrior will be chosen by a wise turtle named Master Oogway. Since Po is late, he cant get in which sets him off on an alternative way to get in, which he does using a chair with a bunch of firework rockets strapped on them, disrupting the event and getting himself chosen as the dragon warrior by Oogway, which peeves the Furious Five and their master, Master Shifu. While this is happening, an evil creature known as Tai Lung is breaking out of prison and can only be stopped by the dragon warrior, who is an inexperienced Panda. Eventually they warm up to Po and train him to be the dragon warrior, and Master Oogway passes on due to his old age. Tai Lung attacks the town and the Furious Five and is ultimately stopped (and killed) by Po. </h4>
  <h5> The reason I put this as one of my favorite movies is because I find it very humorous, finding myself still laughing at jokes after a ton of viewings, and a bit nostalgic, since this was both mine and my mom's favorite movie while growing up. The reason why I put this over Kung Fu Panda 2 or 3 is because I have more nostalgia for this movie and because I find myself finding the more basic story structure more engaging and interesting. </h5>
