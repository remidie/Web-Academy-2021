  <h4 style="color:yellow">"Sonic The Hedgehog" is a video game movie released on February 14, 2020 (a little over a month before the pandemic started) by Paramount Pictures after being delayed due to the backlash from the internet due to Sonic's original design. This movie is inspired by the video game series "Sonic the Hedgehog" wich was first released by Sega in 1991 to give them a mascot so that they could rival Nintendo's monopoly over the video game console market and to compete with Super Mario. The cast of the movie includes Ben Schwartz as Sonic, James Marsden as Tom, and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik/Eggman. A basic synapses of the movie is that as a child Sonic was forced to leave his home planet after native echidnas wanted to harness his powers for evil, and ended up on Earth with a bag of rings that, when thrown, can open portals to other worlds. While on Earth, he stalks Tom and his wife, Maddie, and the other people of the small town of Green Hill, Montana for years, and is feeling very lonely as he never got to do what he wanted to do because he needs to stay hidden and out of sight. While he was playing baseball against himself, he runs around the bases multiple times and accidentally caused an EMP blast which alerts the federal government to his existence. They send Dr. Robotnik to investigate and capture Sonic, so Sonic wants to leave, but after accidentally scaring Tom and getting shot with a dart, he accidentally sends his rings to the transamerica pyramid in San Francisco, and employs Tom's help to get them back. They go on a long road trip and get attacked by Dr. Robotnik, who badly injures Sonic. They get him patched up, get his rings back, and defeat Eggman and sent him to the Mushroom Planet, allowing Sonic to stay on Earth for a while longer. </h4>
  <h5 style="color:yellow"> The reason why I chose this movie as one of my favorites is because it is based off a series that I love and I find the movie very humorous. The reason why I chose this movie over Detective Pikachu is because even though I'd normally prefer Pokemon over Sonic, I find this movie more enjoyable, rewatchable, and humorous than Detective Pikachu, although I really like and enjoy <a href="Detective Pikachu.html" style="color:yellow">Detective Pikachu</a>. A sequel to this movie is set to hit theaters in early 2022.
