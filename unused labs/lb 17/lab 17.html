<p>In the future I wanna be a programmer or an animator or an actor or an editor or a script writer/author. I wanna be a programmer because I find coding fun and intriguing, and I like playing video games, so I would like to develop my own. I would like to be an animator because it seems fun to make 3d models and make a show with them. I wanna be an actor because it seems fun and I'd like to know how well I could bring a fictional character to life. I wanna be an editor because it seems like fun to edit shows, movies, and videos. I wanna be a script writer or an author because it seems fun to make my own story and I would like to know how well I would do.<br>
<br>
I have no clue about which college I wanna go to because I have no clue which colleges exist. The colleges that I do know exist either are focused on fields that I don't care about or I know very little about. I would like to go to a college about writing and animating so I can widely open my potential choices. A college about coding would work too, as it fuulfills the career path that I most wanna go down. An acting college sounds a bit pointless for me to go to, but I would join an acting club in the college I go to.<br>
<br>
There are many potential scholorships that people could get. Unfortunately I have no idea what they are. I hope I get some great scholarships so that college isn't that expensive so that we can save up more money. I could also move to states with cheaper colleges, like Wyoming. Either that or I can skip college and hope that I can make something many people want.</p>
