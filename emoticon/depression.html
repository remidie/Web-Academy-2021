            No matter how severe someone's depression is, they can still be treated effectively. Ways to do this are by using anti-depressants and/or psychotherapy (like cognitive-behavioral therapy interpersonal therapy, or problem-solving therapy). Anti-depressants may take between two and 4 weeks to work, and sometimes during this period people had an increase in suicidal thoughts. If these don't work, then they should try out electroconvulsive therapy or some other brain stimulation therapy. Before taking any option, a medical professional should be consulted.
