      <td>Thomas Alva Edison (Thomas A. Edison) was an American inventor who was born on February 11, 1847 and died on October 18, 1931. He is a controversial figure, as he had sketchy buisness practices, took credit for works that he didn't necessarily make, and his battle against the use of AC systems. Despite all his controversies, Thomas Edison is still instrumental in the invention and innovation of many important things that are still used till this day like light bulbs, movie cameras, the phonogram, among many others. He has over 1,000 patents (1093) to his name, many related to the telegraph and utilities. He set up an industrial research lab in Menlo Park, and by 1887 it had occupied two city blocks and had locks of a ton of things, like thousands of chemicals, hairs of many different kinds of mammals, and all ores. He has worked with the likes of Nikola Tesla, Henry Ford, Edward Goodrich Acheson, William Kennedy Dickson, and Miller Reese Hutchison among others. A great place to learn more about the life and inventions of Thomas Edison you can go take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison"> quick long look here.</a></td>
    <td>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor and electrical engineer who is best known for his work on AC systems, but also invented other things with the help of the discoveries of others. He joined the Continental Edison Company in 1882 while in Paris through his former boss, Tivadar Pusk√°s. He was brought to the US after his manager Charles Batchelor was brought back and requested that they also bring along Tesla. He quit the company after 6 months due to unpaid bonuses, and made his own company with the help of Alfred S Brown and Charles Fletcher Peck, which he called "Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing." In 1887, he developed a motor that ran on AC power, which would eventually lead to them stricking a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for $60,000 and $2.50 royalties per horsepower produced, and Tesla working for them for a year. In 1889 he made and patented the Tesla coil, which started because Tesla had learned about Heinrich's Hertz's experimentation with radio waves/electromagnetic radiation. He has created many other inventions and innovations that are still used today, like his experimentation with x-rays and his teleautomatics.

      <td>Orville and Wilbur Wright (better known as the Wright Brothers) were pioneers of aviation and are credited with creating the first airplane. The project was started by Wilbur, and Orville came on a bit later, and they both take equal credit for their innovation/invention. They drew on the work of Samuel Langley, Otto Lilienthal, Octave Chanute, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Sir George Cayley. They decided to use Lilienthal's strategy of testing out gliding before trying to do motor-controlled flight, and using their power of observation to observe how birds turn and theorize about how they could use that to control their movement in the air and turn. While pondering this, they discovered wing-warping and implemented that into their designs. In 1899, they test out their design with a biplane kite, and in 1900 they did more experimentation in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, although they were recommended to go to the mid-Atlantic coast. They made their wings with camber and they left out tails on their first two gliders as they didn't believe it was necessary. Eventually, in December of 1903, they had successful flights after weeks of delays due to messed up engine tests. They were selling some of their planes to the army, but unfortunately most (if not all) of their planes ended up crashing and killing their pilots.

      <td>Alexander Graham Bell was a scottish-born inventor and buisnessman who invented the first practical telephone and co-founded the company AT&T (originally called American Telephone and Telegraph Company). He started inventing young, making a simple dehusking machine that was used by a mill for a while. He spent some time in Paris, Ontario with his family, brother's widow, and a family friend who is also a baptist minister. In 1874, Bell got Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders to help financially back him while making the telephone. He hired Thomas A. Watson as his assistant and they experimented with their acoustic telegraph. After Watson accidentally plucked a reed, Bell heard some overtones on the recieving side, which eventually led to them making their sound-powered telephone, which was still a far way from transmitting actual voices. He had a quick patent battle with Elisha Gray, which he won, and eventually used Gray's idea of using a liquid transmitter, which worked at transmitting a clear voice to the recieving end. He showcased it off in the 1876 Centennial Exposition, which led to it gaining international attention. In 1915 Bell made the first trans-continental call between New York to San Francisco, with Watson being on the recieving end. He also made other inventions like the photophone, metal detector, and hydrofoils.

      <td>Steve Gary Wozniak (aka Woz) is an inventor who co-founded Apple alongside Steve Jobs, while Steve Jobs was a buisnessman who was essentially the marketing person of Apple. Woz first met Jobs in 1971 through his friend Bill Fernandez and their first buisness deal was when he created his blue box, which allowed people to make free long distance calls, and had Jobs help him sell it. In 1973, Jobs went to work for Atari and had Woz help him make a circuit board for a bonus. In 1975, he developed the Apple 1 and tested it out to impress the members of the Homebrew Computer Club, but it was also popular with people when it was unvielded publicly. He originally tried to sell the computer to HP, but they denied him 5 times, and Jobs eventually convinced him to start a company of their own. They made 50 units and sold all of them to Paul Terrell. He developed the Apple ll in 1976 with it being the first personal computer to have color graphics, and also had the BASIC programming language built in. Woz left Apple in 1985, but founded Cl 9 that same year and developed the first ever universal remote, while Steve Jobs funded the creation of PIXAR for $10 million. Steve Jobs helped create many of Apple's products, like the Iphone, Ipad, and Ipod, among others.
